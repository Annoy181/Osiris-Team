via methods including but not limited to double billing of hours or making “changes for changes sake” i.e ).
- Any potential breach of good faith, will lead to a discussion before

## Scope of work

- The Developer, will receive a list of tasks consisting of for example feature requests or bug fixes.
- These tasks must be clear and concise. The Client must answer Developer’s questions if there is something unclear.
- The Developer may reject to work on a or multiple tasks.
    - In this case, the Developer is also obligated to give a clear and concise reason.
    - If this happens after working on the task, that work/time must **not** be paid by the Client.  
- Each task is to be submitted as separate Merge Request to the Client's fork of a project with a descriptive name  or as seperate Merge Requests to the upstream project on per task basis.
- The Client is allowed to reject any Merge Request and / or request changes.
    - In this case, the Client is also obligated to give clear and concise feedback.
- The Client is responsible for testing if the Merge Request fulfils the requested task.

## Timing

- Time not spent actively working on a Merge Request (MR)
(e.g. Research or writing / committing code), is the Developer' to use as they see fit.
- The Developer can multitask at their complete discretion.
- There is no fixed hours to encourage a healthy study/life/work balance.
- Time tracking can be done via a comment within each MR after the applicable lines of code
have been pushed such as the following example (using ISO-8601 and 24hr clock):
    - 2023-05-16
    - 08:00 - 10:20
    - 12:00 - 13:15
    - Which would be processed as 3h 35m via the following formula: (HR * 3) + (HR * 0.35).

## Payment

### Basic rate: 15€ per hour

| Proposal date | Hourly Rate (HR) in EURO	| % Increase | 
| ------------- | ---------------------     | ---------- |
| 2023-10-03    | 15                        | 117.28  |
| 2023-07-16    | 14.46                     | 113.04  | 
| 2023-06-25    | 12.79                     | 100     |

The "Pro" rate includes some benefits over the "Basic" rate:

- The Client can set deadlines for tasks.
  - The Developer must agree to the deadline in writing and can disagree within 3 days, otherwise, the Developer agrees automatically.
  - If the Developer fails to complete the tasks by the deadline, the rate/payment for those tasks is cut by 50%.
- The Clients' tasks get prioritized over Clients with the "Basic" rate.

In the interest of fairness;
- Clients of the same tier will recive equal treatement in terms of work priority.
- When / If a / additional higher rate client(s) is / are taken on board, "Basic" rate clients are to be advised e.g. 
  "Due to a recent increase in the number of higher tier rated clients (who's tasks have priority), I may take some additional time to respond. My appologies."

### Details

- The rate used in the payment will be the rate with the latest proposal date and mentioned at the top of the contract.
- Payment is to be made to Developer's PayPal email (osiris[underScore]support[aT]proton[DoT]me).
- Payment processing fees and/or currency conversion fees are to be paid by the Developer per PayPal's "Goods and Services" payment type.

Steps:

1. The Developer sends an invoice via email to the Client covering a timespan (usually a month) of unpaid work.
2. The Client has 5 days to complete the payment upon receiving the invoice email.
    - Payment is deemed completed at the time the Developer receives
      confirmation by the payment processor.
