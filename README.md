1. **Cost Efficiency**
1. **Flexibility**
1. **Specialized Skills**
1. **Reduced Overhead Costs**

<summary>Show/Hide full list</summary>

1. **Cost Efficiency:** Freelancers are often more cost-effective because you don't have to provide them with benefits like health insurance, paid time off, or retirement contributions. You also don't have to pay payroll taxes for freelancers.

2. **Flexibility:** You can hire me for specific tasks and change that list whenever you want. This flexibility can be especially beneficial for businesses with fluctuating workloads.

3. **Specialized Skills:** Freelancers often bring specialized skills and expertise to the table. You can find experts in various fields without committing to long-term employment. Freelancers can work from anywhere in the world, giving you access to a broader talent pool and potentially lowering labor costs.

4. **Reduced Overhead Costs:** You don't need to provide freelancers with office space, equipment, or supplies, which can reduce your overhead costs.

**Common Negative Biases Against Freelancers:**

1. **Limited Control:** Freelancers work independently, so you have less control over their work hours, methods, and processes. This can be a disadvantage for projects that require close supervision.
    - There are minimum guaranteed work hours per week depending on your rate and you can specify the methods and processes if you want.

1. **Lack of Loyalty:** Freelancers may not be as invested in your company's success as regular employees. They might prioritize other clients or projects over yours.
    - I have a fixed hourly rate that I am satisfied with and that I think is fair. Clients with the same rate have equal priority.

1. **Communication Challenges:** Managing remote freelancers can be challenging, especially if they are in different time zones or speak different languages. Effective communication is crucial.
    - I speak multiple languages and there are multiple ways of communication depending on the selected rate.

### Workflow
- The initial consulting is free. Please try to be as specific and clear as possible. I will answer all your questions and explain why something can/can't be done. 1 free online meeting of 15 minutes is possible.
- You will get updates regarding the progress, after every 8 hours of work.
- The code will be uploaded to GitHub under a private repository where only you and I have access. This allows us to track all code changes.
- I will work on something until it is finished, or your budget limit is hit, thus tell me your preferred and max budgets.
