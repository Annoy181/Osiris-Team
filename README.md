**Pros:**

1. **Cost Efficiency:** Freelancers are often more cost-effective because you don't have to provide them with benefits like health insurance, paid time off, or retirement contributions. You also don't have to pay payroll taxes for freelancers.

2. **Flexibility:** You can hire me for specific tasks and change that list whenever you want. This flexibility can be especially beneficial for businesses with fluctuating workloads.

3. **Specialized Skills:** Freelancers often bring specialized skills and expertise to the table. You can find experts in various fields without committing to long-term employment. Freelancers can work from anywhere in the world, giving you access to a broader talent pool and potentially lowering labor costs.

4. **Reduced Overhead:** You don't need to provide freelancers with office space, equipment, or supplies, which can reduce your overhead costs.

**Cons:**

1. **Limited Control:** Freelancers work independently, so you have less control over their work hours, methods, and processes. This can be a disadvantage for projects that require close supervision.

2. **Lack of Loyalty:** Freelancers may not be as invested in your company's success as regular employees. They might prioritize other clients or projects over yours.
    - The only thing that determines how invested I am is how much money I make. This is true for everybody (except blood-related employees and the ones that build the company from the ground up I guess).
    - I have a fixed hourly rate that I am satisfied with and that I think is fair.

4. **Communication Challenges:** Managing remote freelancers can be challenging, especially if they are in different time zones or speak different languages. Effective communication is crucial.
    - I speak multiple languages and you can reach me any time via e-mail, phone, or live chat over Discord.
